Cisco AutoConfig
========================

This is a set of scripts to ease configuration of Cisco switches.
The general use-case of these scripts is rather personal, for they are made with the course Data Network in mind.
It shouldn't be too difficult to match these scripts to your own needs, using this project as a general template.
